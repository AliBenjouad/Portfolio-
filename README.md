This portfolio depicts some personal and acedemic projects worked on: 

-> Numerical Optimization:
Academic project that required the use of simulated annealing optimization alongside a genetic eveolution algoritm to efficiently iterate through a large array of solution possibilities and predict the most optimal one.


-> go_game:
It is a go game developped using PyQt6 libraries in order to coordinate the UI with the backend executions during a game, started implementing AI logic for single play.


-> raspberry_pi_radar: 
Using the HCR ultrasonic sensor and a small servo motor mounter on a platform, I made a radar with the classic green and black radar interface and detection range is dynamic, next step is to mount a cam and using tensorflow, make a radar that detects an object and activate the camera and track the object as long as it is in range.


-> EmbeddingStorage.py: 
Script that I use in an AI flask app, the app helps me process information and data overall using openAI's API and methodologies.


-> git_pull_script: 
This is an .sh script that I was exploring into, which is automating the process of the synchronaziation between a local machine and a github repository, this is not the script that achieves that yet, it is however a script that successfully pulls any changes done to a remote repository and updates the local files accordingly upon execution, to take it to the further step, I must add more "rules" to the script and for the workflow.


-> git_push_script: 
This is the push version of the experimental github scripts, it also successfuly is able to push local folders to a remote repository, but it needs further refining just as the git_pull_script.sh


-> gpt_integration.py: 
This is part of an AI flask app and I used the embeddings extracted from the text provided as input and combined it with openAI.s GPT models in order to make a dynamic version of chat gpt when it comes to data analysis, this has further implications that I am still exploring and developping.


-> process.py: 
This is the code that processes some different parts of the flask AI app, it initialiwes the components of the app and handles the route processing in general, this code is an initial version only and has more refining to be done and more upgrades to be applied as well.


-> train_model.py: 
As I am actively trying to get into the AI and ML community through learning and failing and testing and continuing, this is a training script for the BERT model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, that I used a dataset online to train BERT on recognizing entities and skills, the traceback that I get is showing that the BERT has trained succesffuly, howver the metrics of the test script pointed to the fact the data that I used was not sufficient for BERT to make correct predicitions per the test data.


-> transcribe.py: 
One other component of the flask app that I made, this script's main job is to transcribe and extract text from various types of media so that the data is constant for processing.
